            The plot revolves around two young women, Anuja (Kashmira Irani) and Neha (Swarda
            Thigale), who are high school teachers and have been tasked to collect population data for the census. On
            their way to collect the data, they come across a deserted house where a pregnant woman named Prerna (Tina
            Bhatia) welcomes them. When asked about the people who reside there, Prerna answers that there are four
            people in the house: Prerna, her grandmother, an old man, and Bhola (the cook). One of the women points
            towards her baby bump and asks her if it was her first born. Prerna replies with a no, and says that after
            being born, all the newborns cry for some time before hopelessly dying. Although skeptical, the two women
            leave.</p>
